# oled Lock Box

This project was built prior to enrolling in the Flatiron Software Engineering Program.  This was a project done as a hobbyist, with a goal of making a pairing of software and hardware that could help improve peoples habbits.

The code within this repo is intended to be installed on an ESP8266 board.

The program utilizes a library for an Adafruit OLED display, 128x64px with i2c connection protocols. there are cheaper clones of this display available online.

It also utlizes a 5v power supply, capable of being powered off a standard USB 500mah supply (very low power), a single pole relay, and a small 5v solenoid.
